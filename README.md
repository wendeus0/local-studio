# Local Studio

Local Studio is a local-first workstation for running, managing, and using
self-hosted LLM backends. One machine can launch models, watch GPU/runtime
state, chat with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and run agent sessions against
local or remote controllers. Version 2.0 unifies day-to-day operation around
Status, Workbench, Configure, and Usage instead of separate model, integration,
and server surfaces.

It is built from two modules that share one controller API:

- [`controller/`](controller/README.md) — Bun/Hono backend. Owns model lifecycle
  (launch, evict, recipes, downloads, runtime process coordination), an
  OpenAI-compatible proxy (chat, models, tokenization, audio), system state
  (GPU metrics, logs, usage, settings, SSE), and controller integrations.
- [`frontend/`](frontend/README.md) — Next.js 16 + React 19 UI and the macOS
  Electron desktop shell. Hosts the Workbench (`/agent`), consolidated
  Configure surface, settings, usage, logs, and browser-facing API routes.

## What is a controller?

A controller is the backend process the UI talks to — the Bun/Hono
server in `controller/`. You can run one locally or point the frontend at a
remote controller on a GPU host. The controller owns model lifecycle, the
OpenAI-compatible proxy, system state, and SSE event streams.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Bun 1.x (controller), Node.js 22.19+ and npm (frontend),
Python 3.10+ on `PATH` (`uv` strongly recommended; engine installs fall back to
pip), Git. vLLM/SGLang serving on Linux needs NVIDIA driver + CUDA; Apple
Silicon uses the MLX backend.

Run the preflight check first (toolchain, ports, directories, network):

```bash
npm run doctor
```

Start the controller (listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`, data dir + SQLite created
automatically, model weights in `LOCAL_STUDIO_MODELS_DIR`, default `/models`):

```bash
cd controller && bun install && bun src/main.ts
```

Start the frontend in a second terminal, then open
<http://localhost:3000/setup>:

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev
```

`npm ci` runs a postinstall patch against `@earendil-works/pi-ai`. If that step
prints a warning, agent streaming may misrender. The setup wizard walks through
choosing a models directory, installing an engine, downloading a model,
launching it, and benchmarking. Engine installs (vLLM/SGLang/MLX) land in
`<data dir>/runtime/venvs/<backend>-latest`.

## Agent runtime

The agent surface lives at `/agent` in the frontend. It uses
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` through the frontend runtime rather than
shelling out to a separate agent process for normal turns. Agent skills and
extensions are loaded by the frontend runtime and surfaced in the session UI.
Agent file operations are local-only, stored under `data/agentfs`.

## Runtime backends

Recipes launch through the controller runtime layer. Wired backend families:

- `vllm` — vLLM server recipes through configured/discovered/system/Docker/bundled targets.
- `sglang` — SGLang `launch-server` recipes through configured or discovered Python targets.
- `llamacpp` — llama.cpp `llama-server` recipes for GGUF models.
- `mlx` — MLX `mlx_lm.server` recipes for Apple Silicon.

Runtime target discovery, models, integrations, and server controls are
surfaced in Configure; selections persist in the controller data directory.

## Production

Build the frontend, then serve it with the standalone server:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && npm run start
```

`npm run start` launches the standalone server (`scripts/start-standalone.mjs`).
Never use plain `next start` — it breaks SSE streaming. The controller runs the
same way in production as in development: `bun src/main.ts`.

## Remote / LAN deployment

The controller binds `127.0.0.1` by default. Binding a non-loopback host (e.g.
`LOCAL_STUDIO_HOST=0.0.0.0`) requires `LOCAL_STUDIO_API_KEY` — startup throws
without it. On a trusted LAN you may instead set
`LOCAL_STUDIO_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` to opt out of authentication.

Point the frontend at a remote controller with `BACKEND_URL` or
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8080`).

Remote deployment is handled by `scripts/deploy-remote.sh`. Configure
`.env.local` first (see `.env.example`):

```bash
REMOTE_HOST=192.168.x.x
REMOTE_USER=username
REMOTE_PATH=/home/user/project
# Optional: REMOTE_SSH_KEY (defaults to ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
```

```bash
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh controller   # sync + build + restart controller
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh frontend     # sync + build + restart frontend
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh status       # inspect remote processes
```

Local daemon helper: `./scripts/daemon.sh {start|stop|status}`.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check
npm run test:integration
```

The configured pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) checks conventional commits
and runs the frontend quality gate (`npm --prefix frontend run check:quality`)
before pushing.

## Releases

Pushing conventional commits to `main` triggers `release.yml`. Semantic Release
analyzes commits since the last tag, cuts the next tag (`feat` → minor, other
release types → patch, breaking → major), and publishes generated notes. There
is no npm publish and tags are never created by hand.

The public macOS build is produced on a Developer ID-equipped Mac. Stage the
signed DMG, updater ZIP, blockmaps, metadata, and stable website alias after the
build completes:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run desktop:dist
npm run release:stage-desktop
gh release upload "v$(node -p 'require("./frontend/package.json").version')" release-staging/*
```

Run `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=vllm-studio-notarize npm --prefix frontend run
desktop:dist:notarized` when the Apple developer team has an active distribution
agreement. Electron Builder then submits and staples the notarization ticket
before creating the archives.

Remove `frontend/dist-desktop/` and `release-staging/` after installation and
upload; neither directory belongs in git.

## Contributing

Contributions should be small, focused, and easy to review. Start from the
latest `main`, one logical change per branch, no formatting-only rewrites, no
secrets or build artifacts. Run `npm run check` (and `npm run test:integration` for
behavior changes) before opening a PR; include a concise summary, the validation
commands you ran, and screenshots for UI changes. See AGENTS.md for the full
code standards an agent (or contributor) must follow.
